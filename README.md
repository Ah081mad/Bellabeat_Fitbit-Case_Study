# Bellabeat_Fitbit-Case_Study

### Project Overview
 The objective of this analysis was to understand user behavior related to physical activity, sleep, and overall wellness. These insights can help guide smart device feature development and targeted health recommendations for Bellabeat users.


### Data Sources
The primary data used for this analysis was downloaded from kaggle. The datasets include:
- dailyActivity_merged.csv
- sleepDay_merged.csv

### Tool Used
- Microsoft Excel

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation stage, i performed the following tasks:
- Remove duplicates
- Date format standardization
- Merge datasets
- Filterd out zero values
- Missing data handling
- Data type consistency
####  Note and Assumptions
- Users did not consistently track all types of data.
- Zeros were treated as missing or non-tracking days.
- The merging key assumes daily uniqueness per user.

### Exploratory data analysis
EDA involve exploring the Fitbit data to answer key question:
- How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart.

### Data Analysis
- The analysis was performed using Excel( Formula, Functions, and Pivot Table)

### Key Findings
The key findings are summarized as follows:
- Most users are relatively sedentary, and not highly active averaging over 900 sedentary minutes per day.
- Average daily step count is below the recommended 10,000 steps, suggesting low physical activity.
- There is a positive correlation between total steps and calories burned.
- Average sleep duration is around 6.5â€“7 hours, slightly below the recommended 8 hours.
  
### Recommendations
Base on the analysis i recommend the following actions:
- Introduce app notifications or challenges to encourage users to move more and reduce sedentary time.
- Develop personalized sleep tips based on user patterns.
- Enhance user engagement by improving tracking consistency with reminders and gamification.
- Target marketing campaigns based on behavior pattern e.g, active users Vs sedentary. 

### Limitation
- Small sample size
- Collected in 2016
